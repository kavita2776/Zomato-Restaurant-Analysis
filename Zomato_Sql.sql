-- 1. QUICK DATA CHECK
--    Goal: Verify data loaded correctly after Python cleaning
-- ============================================================
SELECT count(*) FROM dbo.cleaned_zomato;

-- 2. TOP 10 RESTAURANTS BY RATING AND VOTES
--    Goal: Identify best-performing restaurants overall
--    Note: Some restaurants have high rating but low votes —
--          this reveals a visibility gap worth investigating
-- ============================================================
SELECT

--    Goal: Find which areas have the highest overall footfall
-- ============================================================
SELECT

-- 4. DEMAND VS SUPPLY RATIO  ← CORE BUSINESS METRIC
--    Goal: Identify high-demand but low-competition areas
--    Logic: votes per restaurant = how much demand each
--           restaurant faces on average in that location
--    Higher ratio = more unmet demand = expansion opportunity
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- 5. DEMAND VS SUPPLY — FILTERED (REMOVES NOISE)
--    Goal: Same as above but only locations with 50+
--          restaurants so small samples don't skew results
-- ============================================================

-- 6. CITY AVERAGE DEMAND-SUPPLY RATIO  ← BENCHMARK
--    Goal: Calculate city-wide baseline for comparison
--    Result: ~440 votes per restaurant across Bangalore

-- 7. TOP EXPANSION CANDIDATES
--    Goal: Locations with above-average ratio AND
--          at least 100 restaurants (meaningful market size)
--    These are the final business recommendations
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- 8. HIGH RATING BUT LOW VISIBILITY
--    Goal: Restaurants rated 4.0+ but with very few votes
--          These are hidden gems — good quality, low reach
-- ============================================================

SELECT
    name,
    location,
    rating,

FROM dbo.cleaned_zomato
WHERE
    rating >= 4.0

-- ============================================================
-- 9. COST VS RATING SEGMENT ANALYSIS
--    Goal: Does higher price mean higher rating?
--          Segments restaurants into 4 price tiers
-- ============================================================
